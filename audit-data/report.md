# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DamnValuableNFT.sol [Line: 14](src/DamnValuableNFT.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public nonce;
	```

</details>



## H-2: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

	```solidity
	contract Exchange is ReentrancyGuard {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	    function safeMint(address to) public onlyRoles(MINTER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
	```

- Found in src/TrustfulOracle.sol [Line: 12](src/TrustfulOracle.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	contract TrustfulOracle is AccessControlEnumerable {
	```

	```solidity
	        onlyRole(INITIALIZER_ROLE)
	```

	```solidity
	    function postPrice(string calldata symbol, uint256 newPrice) external onlyRole(TRUSTED_SOURCE_ROLE) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	```solidity
	        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), id);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/TrustfulOracleInitializer.sol [Line: 13](src/TrustfulOracleInitializer.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	        oracle = new TrustfulOracle(sources, true);
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DamnValuableNFT.sol [Line: 21](src/DamnValuableNFT.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	    function safeMint(address to) public onlyRoles(MINTER_ROLE) returns (uint256 tokenId) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-6: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.
